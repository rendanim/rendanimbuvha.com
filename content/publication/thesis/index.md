abstract: In recent years, wind and other variable renewable energy sources have gained a rapidly increasing share of the global energy mix. In this context the greatest concern facing renewable energy sources like wind is the uncertainty in production volumes as their generation ability is inherently dependent on weather conditions. When providing forecasts for newly commissioned wind farms there is a limited amount of historical power production data, while the number of potential features from different weather forecast providers is vast. Bayesian regularization is therefore seen as a possible technique for reducing model overfitting problems that may arise. This thesis investigates Bayesian Neural Networks in one-hour and day-ahead forecasting of wind power generation. Initial results show that Bayesian Neural Networks display equivalent predictive performance to Neural Networks trained by Maximum Likelihood in both one-hour and day ahead forecasting. Models selected using maximum evidence were found to have statistically significant lower test error performance compared to those selected based on minimum test error. Further results show that the Bayesian Framework is able to identify irrelevant features through Automatic Relevance Determination, though not resulting in a statistically significant error reduction in predictive performance in one-hour ahead forecasting. In day-ahead forecasting removing irrelevant features based on Automatic Relevance Determination is found to yield statistically significant improvements in test error.
